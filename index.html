Aerodynamics play an extremely important role in the motor sporting industry. The way car is shaped and formed 
can dictate how fast it can accelerate, the top cornering speed and the manoeuvrability of the car. Elements, 
such as, the front and rear wing are reliable for most of the aerodynamic efficiency, the front wing is where 
the car first meets the airflow (Martins, Correia,  Silva, (2021)) its job is to redirect the air in the most 
efficient path, without having disrupt the air and cause drag, which would inevitably slow the car down. 
Through new waves of technology and new research methods, the growth of understanding and testing on 
aerodynamics has increased massively, a lot has changed since the 1950s when formula one first began. Multiple 
technological revolutions have happened each decade, from the first front and rear wing to be added to the car, 
to the groundbreaking first use of the wind tunnel.

Without the addition of aerodynamic features to Formula One cars, we would never have made as many 
advancements in the overall speed and efficiency in F1 today. An F1 car without any downforce produced 
by aerodynamics, would generate and produce enough lift to the point where the car could be able to 
“fly” while travelling at 100mph alone (Fields (2015)). However, in this competitive sport the car needs
to be stuck to the track to race. Now if we take the average modern f1 car with all its downforce 
producing aerodynamic parts, the top speed of the car increases significantly to 220mph (Duxbury, 
Holding (2023)), if not more, all whilst keeping all four tyres firmly planted firmly on the ground. 
Nevertheless, Formula One teams did not always have the knowledge of downforce and its performance 
capabilities.

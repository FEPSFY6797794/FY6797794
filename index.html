Aerodynamics play an extremely significant role in the motor sporting industry. The car’s shape and form dictate how fast it can accelerate, the top cornering speed and the manoeuvrability of the car. 
Elements, such as, the front and rear wing are reliable for most of the aerodynamic efficiency, the front wing is where the car first meets the airflow (Martins, Correia,  Silva, (2021)) its job is to 
redirect the air in the most efficient path, without disrupting the air and causing drag, which would inevitably slow the car down.  

Through new waves of technology and new research methods, the growth of understanding and testing on aerodynamics has increased massively, a lot has changed since the 1950s when F1 first began. 
Multiple technological revolutions have happened each decade, from the first front and rear wing to be added to the car, to the groundbreaking first use of the wind tunnel.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

  <pre> 
Without the addition of aerodynamic features to Formula One cars, we would never have made advancements in the overall speed and efficiency in F1 today. An F1 car without any downforce produced by 
aerodynamics, would generate and produce enough lift to the point where the car could be able to “fly” while travelling at 100mph alone (Fields (2015)). However, in this competitive sport the car 
needs to be stuck to the track to race. Now if we take the average modern f1 car with all its downforce producing aerodynamic parts, the top speed of the car increases significantly to 220mph 
(Duxbury, Holding (2023)), all whilst keeping four tyres firmly planted on the ground. Nevertheless, F1 teams did not always have the knowledge of downforce and its performance capabilities.

<h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">
  <pre>
Back in 1950, when the prestigious motor racing competition began (Formula One) the cars on the grid all followed a similar shape and size, since the teams had decided to position their engines at the 
front of the car. Enzo Ferrari had a considerable influence into this decision saying, “The horses should pull the cart, not push it” (Enzo Ferrari, 1959), with a large engine taking up much of the 
front of the car, there was little additional space for aerodynamic design to be added. To aid aerodynamic advantages, the cars were designed in a streamlined fashion, a concept that the airflow over 
the car would be as smooth and uninterrupted as possible. Air, which is considered as a fluid in these situations, would follow the streamlined shape of the car, travelling with low resistance over its 
surface, subsequently decreasing the drag and turbulent air; allowing the vehicle to accelerate faster and reach its top speed in a shorter time (Fields (2015)). This all began to change in 1958, when a 
father and son car company, Cooper, introduced the idea of a mid-engine car. Rather than positioning the engine at the front of the car, it was shuffled further back to be situated right behind the 
driver’s seat and back, this allowed for a more inclined seating position. There were benefits to this, one being that the centre of gravity is lowered (Fields (2015)).  

The next major aerodynamics advancements, came in the form of front and rear wings around the 1970s (Fields (2015)), more specifically it was Colin Chapman, the owner and founder Lotus Racing Team, who 
introduced these components to the Lotus 49 (Castro, Xabier, and Zeeshan A. Rana. (2020)). This helped the team achieve downforce, thereby increasing the tyre’s maximum lateral and tangential forces thus 
improving the car’s ability to efficiently accelerate, braking performances, and increasing the cornering speed. This is all able to happen due to the reduction in drag that occurs with the use of front 
and rear wings. The front wing is the first component of the car that touches the airflow as the car moves (Castro, Xabier, and Zeeshan A. Rana. (2020)), airflow must be directed over the rolling tyres of 
the car, without these wings it can cause huge turbulence, consequently creating more drag and decreasing the top acceleration. Whilst wings started out as a simple aerofoil shape, without the use of 
computer aided simulation testing it was difficult to fully understand how the flow of air over a car could be controlled and manipulated, this was about to change.  

Now in the 1980s, new technological advancements were about to be made, this took the form of the use of wind tunnels, whilst the first run in a wind tunnel was conducted in 1871, by an aeronautical society 
led by Frank Wenham (Baals, Corliss, 1981), a century later Lotus also utilised this modern technology. Lotus primarily embraced the use operation of the tunnel for their Lotus 49 and 79 cars. The Lotus 79 
was one the most revolutionary F1 cars created, with the innovative addition of ‘skirts’, see Table 1 for the features surrounding this car. Engineer Peter Wright, along with some colleagues, formed a design 
that would drastically increase the downforce the car produced (Cotton, 2016). The ‘skirts’ ran parallel to the bodywork of car and extended down onto the track surface, with bristles faintly brushing the 
tarmac, moving up and down with the track surface, a vacuum like quality was created, sucking the whole body down closer to the track (Cotton, 2016). Whilst testing with the wind tunnel they ran into an issue, 
Lotus used a running belt in their wind tunnel, which acted like a conveyor belt, however the car produced so much downforce in testing runs that the belt on the tunnel was forced up towards the body 
(Cotton, 2016). This flaw in the design of the tunnel was how they were able to prove their innovative production of down force. The car went on to win consecutive races and even championships, it was one of 
the most successful race cars to date (Cotton, 2016).  

The introduction of wind tunnels was a crucial, it helped change the scene in Formula One, creating a more competitive sport. Their use provided the teams with a new detailed way of studying cars beyond what 
was previously possible. Before teams relied solely on track testing, however this could lead to discrepancies in their results as there were variables, such as weather conditions, temperatures, and tarmac type, 
that occurred during a track drive (Thakur, 2023).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">
  <pre>
Arguably, the largest change in aerodynamics was a result of wind tunnel development, since then we have developed into a computerised world, instead of just wind tunnel testing, we are able to simulate 
this virtually through use of CFD software (computational fluid dynamics) (Kumarh, no date). Over time, teams have been able to take advantage of these complex software to programme and simulate a larger 
range of scenarios that the car could face allowing iterations of car designs to spark, also thanks to CAD (computer aided design), which reduces time wasted on hand sketching (Thakur, 2023). The modern 
world of F1 is hard to keep up with and is constantly changing with new technological advancement and the sport has developed astonishingly since its beginnings in 1951.

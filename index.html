Aerodynamics play an extremely significant role in the motor sporting industry. The car’s shape and form dictate how fast it can accelerate, the top cornering speed and the manoeuvrability of the car. 
Elements, such as, the front and rear wing are reliable for most of the aerodynamic efficiency, the front wing is where the car first meets the airflow (Martins, Correia,  Silva, (2021)) its job is to 
redirect the air in the most efficient path, without disrupting the air and causing drag, which would inevitably slow the car down.  

Through new waves of technology and new research methods, the growth of understanding and testing on aerodynamics has increased massively, a lot has changed since the 1950s when F1 first began. 
Multiple technological revolutions have happened each decade, from the first front and rear wing to be added to the car, to the groundbreaking first use of the wind tunnel.

Without the addition of aerodynamic features to Formula One cars, we would never have made advancements in the overall speed and efficiency in F1 today. An F1 car without any downforce produced by 
aerodynamics, would generate and produce enough lift to the point where the car could be able to “fly” while travelling at 100mph alone (Fields (2015)). However, in this competitive sport the car 
needs to be stuck to the track to race. Now if we take the average modern f1 car with all its downforce producing aerodynamic parts, the top speed of the car increases significantly to 220mph 
(Duxbury, Holding (2023)), all whilst keeping four tyres firmly planted on the ground. Nevertheless, F1 teams did not always have the knowledge of downforce and its performance capabilities.

Back in 1950, when the prestigious motor racing competition began (Formula One) the cars on the grid all 
followed a similar shape and size, this was due to the fact that all the teams had decided to position their 
engines at the front of the car. Enzo Ferrari had a big influence into this decision as he said, “The horses 
should pull the cart, not push it” (Enzo Ferrari, 1959), with a rather large engine taking up much of the front 
of the car, there was very little additional space for aerodynamic design to be added. To aid in some 
aerodynamic advantages, the cars were designed in a streamlined fashion, the idea being that the airflow over 
the car would be as smooth and as uninterrupted as possible. Air, which is considered as a fluid in these 
situations, would follow the streamlined shape of the car, travelling with low resistance over its surface, 
subsequently decreasing the drag and turbulent air; allowing the vehicle to accelerate faster and reach its top 
speed in as little time as possible (Fields (2015)). This all began to change in 1958, when a father and son car 
company, Cooper, introduced the idea of a mid-engine car. Rather than the engine being placed at the front of the 
car, it was shuffled slightly further back to be situated right behind the driver’s seat and back, this allowed 
for a more inclined seating position. There were a few benefits of this, one being that the centre of gravity is 
lowered (Fields (2015)).  

One of the next major aerodynamics advancements, came in the form of front and rear wings around the 1970s 
(Fields (2015)), more specifically it was Colin Chapman, the owner and founder Lotus Racing Team, who introduced 
these components to the Lotus 49 (Castro, Xabier, and Zeeshan A. Rana. (2020)). This helped the team achieve 
downforce, in turn increasing the tyre’s maximum lateral and tangential forces thus improving the car’s ability 
to efficiently accelerate, braking performances, and increasing the cornering speed. This is all able to happen 
due to the reduction in drag that occurs with the use of front and rear wings. The front wing is the first 
component of the car that touches the airflow as the car moves (Castro, Xabier, and Zeeshan A. Rana. (2020)), 
airflow must be directed over the rolling tyres of the car, without these wings it can cause huge turbulence, 
consequently creating more drag and decreasing the top acceleration. Whilst wings started out as a simple aerofoil 
shape, without the use of computer aided simulation testing it was difficult to fully understand how the flow of 
air over a car could be controlled and manipulated, this was about to change.  

Now in the 1980s, new technological advancements were about to be made, this took the form of the use of wind 
tunnels, whilst the first full run in a wind tunnel was conducted in 1871, by an aeronautical society led by Frank 
Wenham (Baals, Corliss, 1981), almost a century later lotus were the first ever to utilise and bring in the new 
research technology. Lotus primarily embraced the use operation of the wind tunnel for their Lotus 49 and 79 cars. 
The lotus 79 was one the most revolutionary F1 cars to be created with the innovative addition of the ‘skirts’, see 
Table 1 for the features surrounding this car. Engineer Peter Wright along with a few other colleagues had formed a 
design that would drastically increase the downforce the car produced (Cotton, 2016). The ‘skirts’ ran parallel to 
the bodywork of car and extended right down onto the track surface, with bristles faintly brushing the tarmac, they 
would move up and down with the tracks surface, creating and almost vacuum like quality and sucking the whole body 
down closer to the track (Cotton, 2016). Whilst testing with the wind tunnel they ran into an issue, Lotus used a 
running belt in their wind tunnel, which acted similar to a conveyors belt, however the car produced so much 
downforce in its testing runs, that the belt on the tunnel would be forced up towards the body (Cotton, 2016). This 
flaw in the design of the wind tunnel was how they were able to prove their creative production of down force, the 
car went on to win consecutive races and even championships, it was one of the most successful race cars to date 
(Cotton, 2016).  

The introduction of wind tunnels was a crucial, it helped change the scene in Formula One in creating a more 
competitive atmosphere. Their use provided the teams with a new detailed way of studying and advancing they are cars 
beyond what was previously possible. Before teams relied solely on track testing, however this could lead to 
discrepancies in their results as there are many variables that take place during a track drive, from weather 
conditions, to temperature, to tarmac type (Thakur, 2023).
